# SPARK

A little server mocking the [Strike (Acinq)](https://strike.acinq.co/) API.

[strike documentation](https://strike.acinq.co/documentation/api-reference)
and test the webhooks and the charge creation with testnet !**

## Install

required: the [go programming language](https://golang.org/dl/)

Install with `go get github.com/edouardparis/spark`
Test with `go test ./...`
